=== Regression Analysis: Run Length vs Win ===

PC Mean Run Length vs PC Win:
  Correlation (r): +0.0000
  Linear Model:    P(PC Win) = 0.0000 + +0.0000 * PC_Mean_Run

NPC Mean Run Length vs PC Win:
  Correlation (r): +0.0000
  Linear Model:    P(PC Win) = 0.0000 + +0.0000 * NPC_Mean_Run

Run Length Difference (PC - NPC) vs PC Win:
  Correlation (r): +0.0000
  Linear Model:    P(PC Win) = 0.0000 + +0.0000 * (PC_Run - NPC_Run)

Interpretation:
  Weak/No significant correlation - run length difference does not strongly predict winner.
